To whomever is reading this, these are the steps I took to develop this site. 
1. I started by taking some notes on how I wanted the layout of the website to look like, as well as writing down any headings and introductions. 
2. I searched for specific images that would resemble what I wanted to demonstrate in this portfolio and I added all the imagees to my "images" folder. 
3. I updated all my socials and took note of all my links that I wanted to reference on the site for the "contact me" section.
4. After gathering everything I made a very simple #reset.css and then started making the rubric of my index.html.
5. After making my index.html I made sure all the links were functioning in order to start working on my #style.css.
6. Lastly I started editing the characteristics of the webpage with #style.css.
